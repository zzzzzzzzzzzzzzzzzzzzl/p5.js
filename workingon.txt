ok. need to .. my brain feels lumpy, pain behind eye. having concentration problems and struggling with certain words for the last few days.
hopefully not permanant that would suck, probably need to do exercise and fix sleep schedule though, hopefully we will be fine in a few days.

ok things to fix add for p5.js, the scope of the project is to big and doing it as a react app might not be the right place, so lets just make something that looks good
and shows off some features.

make it so that cells cant leave the green circle that shoudl be our environment boundry. 

refactor redux.
redux is a mess. 

refactor ui.
remove most of the ui its mostly useless.
